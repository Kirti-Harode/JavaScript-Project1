# SAVE THE EARTH

"Save the Earth" is a Solar system game, implemented using javascript, HTML5 canvas, webpack and utilizing Object Oriented design principles.

## Overview

Game will be setup in our solar system which will have a stationary sun and planets revolving around it (including earth) in circular orbits. There will be an ongoing fire of comets from left side of the gaming frame which may or may not hit the earth. Player will have a gun at the bottom of the frame which he can move 180 degree and fire a bullet which user can use to destroy a comet. If earth is not destroyed by a comet within a specified time, player wins. There will also be a timer which player will see outside of the gaming frame.


## Functionality & MVPs

  In Save The Earth, the game's features will be:

  * Game will be timer based (no score). Player's job is to save Earth from comets      within the time limit.
  * Player will able to Start, pause the game.
  * Pause and start button for music.
  * Game will have multiple levels.
  * With each level number of comets wil increase and there direction will change.
  


## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

  * Canvas API to create solar sytem and comets.
  * Webpack to bundle and transpile the source Javascript code
  * node.js/npm to manage project dependencies

## Implementation Timeline

  * **Prep for project:** Become familier with libraries and create the project files and README.
  * **Day 1:**  Create basic framework to run the game. Draw stationary Sun and planets
  * **Day 2:**  Write code for moving the planets and a moving gun.
  * **Day 3:**  Code for firing comets in the direction of earth, conduct testing to check everything is working as intended.
  * **Day 4:**  Code for detecting collision (earth and comet, comet and bullet).
  * **Day 5:**  Code for showing explosion graphics and Game over message.
  * **Day 6:**  Add more level (fire comets from two directions instead of one)
  * **Day 7:**  Testing and submission.

## Bonus features

  * Add option for reflecting the comets insted shooting them
